mwthr uses National Weather Service (NWS) static data:

    NWS public forecast zones in (windows-1252) -
    http://www.weather.gov/geodata/catalog/wsom/data/bp01de10.dbx
    http://www.weather.gov/geodata/catalog/wsom/html/cntyzone.htm

    NEXRAD locations -

mwthr uses Java-ML by Thomas Abeel, Yves Van de Peer, and Yvan Saeys,
available from http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/. A copy of the Java-ML JAR is
included here for convenience.

For IP address geolocation, mwthr uses GeoLite data created by MaxMind,
available from http://www.maxmind.com/. The buildfile will download the
GeoLite data as well as the API source, and patch the source slightly to be
compatible with Google App Engine.
